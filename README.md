# JSONCreator ðŸš€

If you're a beginner or looking to create JSON files quick and easily, JSONCreator helps you make JSON files fast.

How it works:
Open the app.
Type a name for your key.
Pick what kind of value it is (Number, Text, True/False).
Type in the value.
Add more keys if you want.
Save your JSON. Done!

For example here's what I put for the values
